# frontend

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Environment Variables

Configure the API base URL in a `.env` file (or the Netlify dashboard when deploying):

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

For production deployments, point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at your hosted backend, e.g.:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://challenge-me-backend-frh7.onrender.com/api
```

If your health-check route differs from the API root, optionally set `VITE_API_HEALTHCHECK_URL`.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```
